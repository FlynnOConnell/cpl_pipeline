    cpl_pipeline

.. _quickstart:

cpl_pipeline is heavily adapted from the methods and code described in Mukherjee, Wachutka, & Katz (2017) [1]_.
- code found at `bleckpy on github<https://github.com/nubs01/blechpy>`_.

Quickstart
==========

For more complete installation instructions, see :ref:`install <install>`.

1. Using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    # clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/FlynnOConnell/cpl_pipeline.git
    cd cpl_pipeline

    # install the package with pip
    pip install -e .

    # OR install via setup.py
    python setup.py install

2. Conda/Mamba (coming soon)

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install cpl_pipeline

Semi-Supervised Spike Sorting
=============================

This Python repository is adapted from the methods and code described in Mukherjee, Wachutka, & Katz (2017) [1]_.
A large percentage of the clustering parameters were made in reference to Reddish (2005) [2]_.

.. note::

   This program is designed for sorting spikes from electrophysiological recordings into single, isolated units. The primary input is a .h5 file containing the continuous signal or thresholded waveforms.

Sorting Criteria
----------------
The primary criteria for considering a unit isolated are:

#. 1 ms ISIs must be <= 0.5%
#. The waveform must be cellular
#. The unit must be sufficiently separated based on Mahalanobis distribution
#. L-Ratio must be <= 0.1, as described in Schmitzer-Torbert et al. (2005) [2]_.


Post-Processing
---------------

The post-processing is carried out via a GUI.

.. note::

   This step requires both the .h5 files and the output folders from the Processing step.
